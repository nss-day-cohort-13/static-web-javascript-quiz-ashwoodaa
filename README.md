# The Static Web HTML + CSS Quiz

## Setup

When you are ready to start the quiz, request the Github Classroom link from your instructor.  
+ Once your repository is created on GitHub, execute the following command in your terminal:  

```bash
mkdir -p ~/workspace/quizzes/static-web/html && cd $_
```

+ You will now be inside your project folder and can intialize a local repo for your project with 
```bash
git init
```
+ Now run the following commands:
```bash
git remote add origin (plus your GitHUb repo address, ie https://github.com/nss-day-cohort-13/static-web-html-css-quiz-JoeShep)
git pull origin master
```

Add one line to your README file. It can be anything. We just need to make a change on the master branch, add it, and commit it, before switching to a quiz branch.  
Now you've connected your remote and local repos and are ready to get to work. All of your quiz work should be on a branch, NOT on master. To do this, type:

```bash
git checkout -b quiz
touch index.html
touch quiz.css
```

You are now ready to work in the `quiz` branch.

When your work in complete, push up the branch (`git push origin quiz`) and submit the pull request on Github.
